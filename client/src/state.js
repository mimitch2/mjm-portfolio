      content: "CSS’ clip-path property is your ticket to shape-shifting the monotonous, boxy layouts traditionally associated with flat, responsive design. You will begin to think outside the box, literally, and hexagons, stars and octagons will begin to take form on your web pages.  Once you get your hands dirty with clip-path, there’s no end to the shapes you can generate, simply by tweaking a few values. While the focus of this article is on clip-path using polygons with CSS, all of the demos provide a reference to an inline SVG, in order to gain additional support on Firefox. Generating a responsive SVG clipped shape is trivial once you have created a responsive shape with CSS’ clip-path. We’ll look at this in detail later.",

      content: "React Router uses a declarative, component based approach to routing. What that means is when you want to create a new route, you render a Route component. If you’re familiar with React Router you know that to do that, you pass Route a path and a component to render when the app’s location matches that path."
